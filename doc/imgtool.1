.SS Descrtiption
.PP
imgtool is a tool for dating, renaming, organizing, resizing, rotating
and thumbnailing images based on the information stored in their EXIF
header.
This is to aid in the processing and organizing of digital photography
images.
.SS Background
.PP
With a fairly large collection of digital photos I have taken with my
phone and three different Nikon cameras.
.PP
In an effort to have unqique file names, I wrote this tool.
I also added the functionality of a couple other operations I frequently
do in post\- processing.
.PP
A number of graphics tools will honor the Orientation tag in an image,
however, on occasion, I find I need to manually rotate an image.
More commonly, images get resized and renamed.
Sometimes other tools are employed which modify the timestamp of the
file, on the files system, which can disrupt sorting.
(I use a date descending order in my file manager to show me the most
recent photos) The default operation of imgtool is to set the timestamp
of the files it finds with the date stamp in the photo\[aq]s EXIF
header.
.PP
Files can be moved (or copied if to a different device) to another
directory.
The naming can have embedded exif data just like the format option.
This would allow creation of a directory structure based on image data.
E.g., \f[C]~/Photos/%Y\-%m\-%d\ .\f[] will create a tree of directories
based on the EXIF (or file) Date/Time.
Any subdirectory trees are maintained.
.PP
\f[I]If an output directory is specified, and, no other renaming is
done, for operations such as dating or resizing, the file is
\f[B]copied\f[] to the output directory instead of renaming.\f[]
.SS Digital Photography Images
.PP
Files created by digital photography have a header built\-in called
\f[I]Exhangeabe Image Format\f[] or EXIF
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) header.
There is a lot of information that can be in this header that relates to
the photograph, when it was taken, sometimes where it was taken, camera
settings, camera model, etc.
This tool extracts this information and uses it to create unique names
for photography files, rotate them, etc.

.SS resize

.SS Geometry
.PP
Geometry can be specified as a percentage of the overall image or as a
pair of width:height.
Width and height are specified in pixels.
If width is specified but no height, e.g., 1000: the image will be
reized to a width of 1000px with a height calculated in relation to
width to maintain the image aspect ratio.
Conversely, height is specified without a width, e.g., :1000 will resize
the image to 1000px high with a width calculated to maintain the aspect
ratio.
When the width and height are spcecified no attempt to maintain the
aspect ratio is made.
.SS Order of operations
.PP
Each image processed, if the operations are specified, has their
operations peformed in this order: 1.
Image resize 2.
Auto\-rotation 3.
Dating and/or Renaming 4.
Thumbnail generation
.SS Automatic Image Naming
.PP
Formatting filenames for automatic renaming is as follows:
[\@|+]type.Tag%timefmt
.PP
Tags starting with \@ have their spaces replaced with periods (.), Tags
starting with + do not have spaces replaced.
There are two types of tags, File and Exif.
File Tags are:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
File.Name:\ \ Filename\ of\ the\ image\ without\ extension
File.Ext:\ \ \ Extension\ of\ filename,\ e.g.,\ .JPG\ 
File.ext:\ \ \ Extension\ of\ filename\ converted\ to\ lower\-case,\ e.g.,\ .jpg
File.Fullname:\ Full\ name\ of\ file\ with\ directories.
File.mtime:\ String\ representation\ YYYYMMDDhhmmss\ of\ the\ file\[aq]s\ timestamp\ in
the\ filesystem.
\f[]
.fi
.PP
EXIF Tags vary by image and camera.
The program exiftool may be useful in finding appropriate tags.
When specifying EXIF Tags, they are formatted as Exif.Image.Model which
results in a string, for one of my cameras, as \[aq]NIKON D3400\[aq],by
default the resultant string will have spaced replaced with periods (.),
to suppress this behavior, precede them with a plus (+).
E.g.:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\@Exif.Image.Make\ returns\ \[aq]NIKON.D3400\[aq]\ where\ +Exif.Image.Make\ 
returns\ \[aq]NIKON\ D3400\[aq]\ 
\f[]
.fi
.PP
This conversion is done just before substituting the tag with its value.
.SS Splitting strings in tags
.PP
Splitting the tag values can be done as an index of space separated
words or as asubstring.
.SS Indexing
.PP
To use an index, place the index number in brackets, e.g,
\@Exif.Image.Make [1] returns \[aq]D3400\[aq] instead of \[aq]NIKON
D3400\[aq].
Index values start with 0.
.SS Substrings
.PP
To use a substring, place the start and, optionally the length in
parentheses.
E.g,: \@Exif.Image.Make(7,5) will return \[aq]D3400\[aq] instead of
\[aq]NIKON D3400\[aq].
If the second value is omitted the length of the value, starting at the
first number is presumed, so \@Exif.Image.Make(7) will also result with
\[aq]D3400\[aq]
.PP
Any EXIF Tag present in the image EXIF header can be used to create all
or part of a file name.
For example,
\f[C]\@Image.Make[1]_\@File.name\@File.ext\ will\ create,\ from\ DSC_328.JPG\ a\ name\ of\ \[aq]D3400_DSC_328.jpg\[aq].\f[]
.PP
Note that the \@File tags are never evaluated with a plus instead of an
at\-sign, and no indexing or substring operations are performed.
.PP
Time formatting, using the EIXF header\[aq]s image time, is formatted
using strftime(3) format, or with the following formatting keys:
.IP

.SS Some tips
.IP "1." 3
Always backup data!
.IP "2." 3
Before emplyoing this tool on a number of photos, be sure it will do
what you want it to do using the \-D or \-\-dry\-run option.
This will tell you most of what operations are being done without
actually doing them.
.IP "3." 3
When using EXIF tags for renaming files from multiple camera
make/models, do not use vendor specific tags, e.g.
Exif.NikonFi.FileNumber as these may not be consistent across those
cameras even for the same manufacturer.
.SS Installation
.SS Pre\-requisites
.PP
imgtool requires the following python packages in order to work \-
pyexiv2 \- https://github.com/escaped/pyexiv2 \- Pillow \- (pip install
pillow)
.PP
The standard modules used are: \- os \- OS Dependent interfaces \- sys
\- System interfaces \- datetime, time \- Date and time manipulation and
conversions \- re \- Regular expression library \- fnmatch, glob2,
shutil \- File globbing, matching and copying.
.PP
This tool was developed on Linux.
While untested it may work on OSX and Windows provided these libraries
are installed.
.PP
The installer script will install the files, based on what is in
installer.json, to appropriate directories with the specified mode.
.SS Running the installer script:

Running installer without arguments will install the program to
/usr/bin, the manual page to /usr/man/man1, and this file to
/usr/share/doc/imgtool.
You must have appropriate access rights, e.g.:, sudo, to perform this
install.
The installer can write to other directories.
Specifying \[aq]none\[aq] as the deestination will prevent that part
from being copied.
