## Thumbnails
Thumbnails may be created or extracted from the EXIF data, when present. 

### Creating thumbnails from image
When generating thumbnails from image data, they are written to the 
diretory specified with the --thumb-dir option or to the same path
where the file is ultimately written using the pattern 
filename-thumb.png.

### Creating thumbnails from EXIF data
Thumbnails are often stored in the images EXIF header. These files are 
written with the same rule for paths of thumbnails above, but, they are
written as JPEG images. Unless --exif-rotate-thumb is set, the thubnail
is not rotated. If -a or --rotation-angle is set then that angle is used
to rotate images otherwise the Exif.Image.Orientation data is used and 
if appropriate the thumbnail will be rotated.
