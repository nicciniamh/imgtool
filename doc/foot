## Issues
- The documentation has some missing parts from the auto-generated 
stuff from reading the help output from imgtool. 
- Not fuly tested, but working on it. 

## WARNING

This tool is ALPHA. I have tested it in a limited environment and was
written to work with my photographs. It may even be destructive. Backing
up data is always a good idea before employing automatic tools that can
recurse directories. If you break something, you own the remaining
pieces.
