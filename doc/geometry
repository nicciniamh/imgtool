## Geometry

Geometry can be specified as a percentage of the overall image or as a
pair of width:height.  Width and height are specified in pixels. If
width is specified but no height, e.g., 1000: the image will be reized
to a width of 1000px with a height calculated in relation to width to
maintain the image aspect ratio. Conversely, height is specified without
a width, e.g., :1000 will resize the image to 1000px high with a width
calculated to maintain the aspect ratio.  When the width and height are
spcecified no attempt to maintain the aspect ratio is made.
