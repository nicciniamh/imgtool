## Installation

## Pre-requisites
imgtool requires the following python packages in order to work
- pyexiv2 -   https://github.com/escaped/pyexiv2
- Pillow -    (pip install pillow)

The standard modules used are:
- os  -               OS Dependent interfaces
- sys -               System interfaces
- datetime, time -    Date and time manipulation and conversions
- re -                Regular expression library
- fnmatch, glob2, shutil - File globbing, matching and copying.

This tool was developed on Linux. While untested it may work on 
OSX and Windows provided these libraries are installed.

The installer script will install the files, based on what is
in installer.json, to appropriate directories with the specified
mode. 

### Running the installer script:
```
usage: installer [-h] [--bindir program-dir] [--docdir doccument-dir]
                 [--mandir man-dir] [--libdir library-dir]
                 [--sources source-list]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help              show this help message and exit
  --bindir program-dir    Directory to store executable(s)
  --docdir doccument-dir  Directory to store document(s)
  --mandir man-dir        Directory to store manual page(s)
  --libdir library-dir    Directory to store library files(s) (Not used for this tool)
```

Running installer without arguments will install the program to 
/usr/bin, the manual page to /usr/man/man1, and this file to
/usr/share/doc/imgtool. You must have appropriate access rights, 
e.g.:, sudo, to perform this install. The installer can write to
other directories. Specifying 'none' as the deestination will prevent 
that part from being copied.
