## Some tips
1. Always backup data!
2. Before emplyoing this tool on a
number of photos, be sure it will do what  you want it to do using the
-D or --dry-run option. This will tell you most  of what operations are
being done without actually doing them.
3. When using EXIF tags for renaming files from multiple camera 
make/models, do not use vendor specific tags, e.g. Exif.NikonFi.FileNumber
as these may not be consistent across those cameras even for the same
manufacturer.
