Imgtool JPEG Photo tool

Renames, reorients, resizes and/or timestamps jpg files with a unique name based on
camera model and taken date stored in the exif header. By default imgtool updates
the atime/mtime timestamps on a file to match the exif header data.
.SH WARNING
This tool is ALPHA. I have tested it in a limited environment and was written to work with my photographs. It may even be destructive. Backing up data is always a good idea before employing automatic tools that can recurse directories. If you break something, you own the remaining pieces.
